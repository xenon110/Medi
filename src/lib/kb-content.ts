    overview:
      'Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. It often starts in childhood but can occur at any age. The condition results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, leading to a compromised skin barrier that is more susceptible to irritants and allergens.',
    symptoms: [
      'Dry, sensitive skin',
      'Intense itching, especially at night',
      'Red to brownish-gray patches, particularly on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, and in the bends of the elbows and knees',
      'Small, raised bumps, which may leak fluid and crust over when scratched',
      'Thickened, cracked, scaly skin',
    ],
    causes:
      'The exact cause of eczema is unknown, but it\'s thought to be linked to an overactive immune system that responds aggressively to irritants. A gene variation affecting the skin\'s barrier function can also play a role. Common triggers include dry skin, irritants like soaps and detergents, stress, and allergens like pollen or pet dander.',
    homeRemedies: [
      'Moisturize your skin at least twice a day with a thick cream or ointment.',
      'Take daily baths or showers with lukewarm water and a gentle, non-soap cleanser.',
      'Apply a cold, wet compress to the affected area to relieve itching.',
      'Wear smooth, breathable clothing and avoid scratchy fabrics like wool.',
      'Use a humidifier in dry or cold weather.',
    ],
    medicalRecommendation:
      'AI analysis suggests that if your symptoms are severe or not improving with home care, a dermatologist consultation is highly recommended. They may prescribe topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or other medications to control inflammation and itching. Light therapy or injectable biologics may be options for severe cases.',

    overview: 'Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the rapid build-up of skin cells. This build-up of cells causes scaling on the skinâ€™s surface. Inflammation and redness around the scales are common. Psoriatic scales are whitish-silver and develop in thick, red patches. Sometimes, these patches will crack and bleed.',

        'Take daily baths with colloidal oatmeal or Epsom salts.',
        'Use moisturizer daily, especially after bathing.',
